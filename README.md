# DiscordThemer
Xposed module that allows you to change colors in Discord. Requires enabled Resource Hooks in EdXposed / LSPosed Manager settings.

**Note**: This app doesn't support Android below version 6.0, on lower versions may crash or just not work.

If you don't use [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) you may need to reboot to see all your changes.
